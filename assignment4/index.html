             This land was host to a group of Natives known as the Menominee peoples. The land was discovered in 1634 by the famous French explorer Jean Nicolet. The French had
             established a fur trading outpost by 1655; as it was near both the Mississippi and Fox river, crucial trade routes during the fur trade. By the early 1700s,
             the French established the fort Saint Francis. The British had conquered the area and rebuilt the fort in 1761 under their own flag. The British had then abandoned the fort in 1763.

             the fur trade had started to decline, and thus they needed to have more use for the area.

            There was continued sawmills and harvest happening on Menominee land from 1827 onward. The "Americanization"
            and settlement of the reigon had continued, as Wisconsin was added as a formal state to the United States in 1851.
            More and more sawmills and lumber harvesting had continued due to Manifest Destiny. It became a hotbed for farming,
            lumber, and a more dense population. During this time The establishment of Wisconsin as a state had occured in 1851, and 
            the establishment of villages and subdivisons of Green Bay had taken place.
